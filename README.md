# MicrosoftGraphTest
This is to test Microsoft Graph Email Send, Receive, and Delete functionalities

This program would run right out of the box if you supply your ClientId, TenantId, Username, and Password for the Microsoft Office365 Email Account

This requires Application Registration in Azure. Make sure the scope defined in this program is included in the app registration, and make sure that the 
account is allowed to authenticate as a desktop application
